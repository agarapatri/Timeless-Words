# Timeless Words – Project Documentation

## Overview
Timeless Words is a static, offline-friendly reading platform for Vedic literature. Everything served on the public site lives under `docs/`. The data pipeline ingests JSON source texts, compiles a relational SQLite catalog, and enriches it with transformer-based semantic vectors to power verse lookup and “search by meaning.” Helper scripts under `docs/scripts/` orchestrate this build, while `notes_n_extras/` preserves research assets, UI experiments, and sample corpora.

### Data & Semantic Search Workflow
1. Curate JSON corpora (see `notes_n_extras/json_samples/` or generate via `docs/scripts/open_ai/`).
2. Run `python docs/scripts/build_library_sqlite_from_jsons.py` (or `python docs/scripts/run.py`) to rebuild `docs/assets/data/library.{{DB_VERSION}}.sqlite`.
3. Run `python docs/scripts/build_semantic_pack.py --source docs/assets/data/library.{{DB_VERSION}}.sqlite --out docs/assets/data/semantic/library.semantic.v01.sqlite`, then `python docs/scripts/encode_semantic.py`, followed by `python docs/scripts/build_semantic_manifest.py` to refresh semantic assets.
4. Deploy through GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/cache-bust.yml`), which stamps `{{VERSION}}`, `{{DB_VERSION}}`, and `{{SEM_VERSION}}` before publishing `docs/` to GitHub Pages.

## Maintenance Tips
- Re-run `python docs/scripts/run.py` whenever JSON sources change to rebuild both relational and semantic assets.
- For local semantic search testing, run `node docs/tests/serve.js` to enable OPFS and fetch wasm assets correctly.
- Before committing large regenerated files (SQLite/ONNX), confirm whether the workflow or `.gitignore` expects versioned copies.
